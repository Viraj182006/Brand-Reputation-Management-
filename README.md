**Personal Description of How I Created This ORM Strategy Document**

This Online Reputation Management (ORM) strategy document is something I created with a mix of research, structured planning, and assistance from AI tools—mainly ChatGPT. While AI helped me organize and fine-tune my thoughts, the process was very much driven by my own intention to build a high-quality, usable, and practical framework for managing a brand’s online presence.

To begin, I wanted to create a well-organized and strategic document that covers all key aspects of ORM. I had a rough idea of what I wanted the structure to be like—starting from monitoring brand mentions, all the way to managing a crisis and reporting on performance. I used ChatGPT to help me break down this plan logically, making sure every section has a clear purpose and connects to the next.

For the **introduction**, I worked to explain what ORM really is and why it matters in today’s digital world. This part was important to me because I’ve seen how one bad review or social media post can go viral and affect a brand’s image overnight. I asked ChatGPT to help me phrase the goals clearly: things like monitoring sentiment, responding professionally to feedback, and encouraging loyal customers to advocate for the brand. The way these points were written took a few tries, as I wanted them to sound natural and direct—not robotic or overdone.

In the **monitoring strategy** section, I wanted to highlight the importance of staying alert to what's being said about the brand. I made sure to include useful tools like Google Alerts, Brand24, and Hootsuite—most of which I found through my own knowledge and cross-checked with ChatGPT for their latest capabilities. Listing the tools with their purpose helped me make the document feel more actionable instead of just theoretical.

When it came to **handling negative reviews**, I was very focused on creating a respectful and solution-oriented response flow. I typed out my thoughts, and then used AI to polish the tone and make the wording sound empathetic yet professional. I added a response template and a do's and don'ts list to make it practical for real-world usage. I really liked how this part turned out because it reflects a balance of brand protection and customer care.

For the **positive engagement** section, I added strategies like requesting reviews, featuring testimonials, and encouraging user-generated content. I believe this is one of the most powerful ways to grow organically. I used Canva and other tools mentioned in this section in my past work, so including them here felt authentic. AI helped me make the language clean and concise.

The **internal guidelines and crisis management** page was a bit more technical. I asked ChatGPT to help format the escalation process and to draft a basic crisis communication plan. I then customized it according to what I think would actually work for a medium or growing business.

Finally, in the **performance tracking and implementation checklist**, I wanted to make sure users of this document can measure success. So I included metrics like sentiment trends, resolution time, and customer satisfaction—plus tools like Google Data Studio and SEMrush. I wanted to ensure that this wasn’t just a strategy document but something that teams could actually execute.

Overall, while AI gave me structure and helped enhance the writing, this document is a result of my understanding, effort, and intention to create something practical. I took time to think through every section, reworked a lot of content, and made sure the tone was consistent and easy to follow. This document is not just created by a tool—it’s crafted by me, with the support of modern technology.
